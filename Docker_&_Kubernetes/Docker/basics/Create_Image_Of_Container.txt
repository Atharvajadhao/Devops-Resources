Create a container first:
	> sudo docker run -it --name newContainer1 ubuntu /bin/bash

Go in the container and do:
	> cd ~
	> touch myFile.txt

Now if you want to see the difference between the base image and changes on it:
	> sudo docker diff newContainer1
	Output: C /root
		A /root/.bash_history
		C /tmp	
		A /tmp/myFile.txt

Now create image of this container:
	> sudo docker commit newContainer1 containerimage1
	> sudo docker images

Now create container from the image:
	> docker run -it --name container2 containerimage1

Now go in the newly created container and check if the created file exist their or not:
	> cd ~
	> ls
