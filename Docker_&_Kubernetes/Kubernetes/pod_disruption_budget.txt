Pod Disruption Budget (PDB) is a Kubernetes resource that allows you to define policies to limit the number of pods that can be simultaneously disrupted during voluntary disruptions (like rolling updates) or involuntary disruptions (like node failures). PDBs help ensure the availability of applications during maintenance, updates, or failures by controlling the number of pods that can be taken down concurrently.

We will add PDB for frontend-deployment
YAML file for PDB:
	apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
	kind: PodDisruptionBudget
	metadata:
	  name: frontend-pdb
	spec:
	  minAvailable: 2
	  selector:
	    matchLabels:
	      app: frontend

> kubectl apply -f pdb-frontend.yml

Now check, on which node a frontend pod is running
Drain that node and watch.
	
	> kubectl drain ip-172-31-38-98.ap-south-1.compute.internal --ignore-daemonsets

You will see that, after draining the node the pod will get evicted and will be scheduled on new node

To get back you node to be working again do:
	> kubectl uncordon ip-172-31-38-98.ap-south-1.compute.internal
