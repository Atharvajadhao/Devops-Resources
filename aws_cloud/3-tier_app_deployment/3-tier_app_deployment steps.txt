
Login in to the mysql db instance:
mysql-endpoint = mysql-db-1.cz5g0vbozj32.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com

Install mysql client:
sudo apt install mysql-client

Connect to db using mysql-client:
mysql -h mysql-db-1.cz5g0vbozj32.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p 

create databse chatdb;



First we are created one network

In this network u created three subnetworks

one is public subnet
another two is private subnets
after that your launching instances as part of your deployment 
you required a frontend and backend
in this frontend we are exposng to outside world in this case we launching instance with public-ip.
backend-server doesn't required public connection
so you need to deploy application backend server you need to ssh to backend for this case study you need to connect backend instance via frontend
backend application server application server need to connect to database in this case you need to install mysql-client
and then we are establishing backend to database

now you need to deploy application in the backend

clone the respective application repo
and then you need to watch demo video take it as reference

update database details in settings.py
host "endpoint-ysqldb"
username ""
database "chatdb"
password ""
port "3306"


sudo systemctl status gunicorn

wyour application working

Then ====> exit==>backend

In the frontend

sudo apt install nginx



update backend ip in the proxypass port

after that sudo systemctl restart nginx


take this public-ip

paste it in the browser and access through browser

telent backend-ip port

curl http://backend-ip:port
